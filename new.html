                    I am currently a student in the coding bootcamp at Columbia University. I have no prior experience 
                    in computer programming so I am very excited to embark on this new adventure! I am very interested in
                    the details of learning codes and it's functions, along with the creative aspect of it as well. The class
                    is very challenging and there is a lot of material we are covering. However, I know with hard work and 
                    perseverance you can achieve anything! I danced for the NFL as a New York Jets Cheerleader after many 
                    years of auditioning. I trained hard and never gave up, even when I felt like I was out of my league. 
                    So I look forward to see where coding takes me in the pursuit of finding a more fulfilling and meaningful career!

                    When I'm not learning to code, I enjoy movies, Bikram yoga and spending time with my family which consists 
                    of my boyfriend, Jesse and our Mini Golden Retriever, Milo. People often say, "I didn't know they made mini
                    golden retrievers!" Well we did not either! They are mixed with cocker spaniels and that's how they stay 
                    small. Milo is full grown at 30lb and is the perfect NYC apartment size pup! It will be nice someday to have 
                    a backyard for Milo to run in. I have been living in New York for 10 years now and I hope to make it back out 
                    to Seattle where I am originally from.
